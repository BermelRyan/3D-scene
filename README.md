1.) How do I approach designing software?

- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

The new design skils that had helped me work on this project was everything I learned over the last 8 weeks. Even though I am an adement gamer, I have never heard of OpenGL before hand so everything was new to me.

- What design process did you follow for your project work?

The process I followed was tackling the modules each week to create the 3D scene, including creating the object, the camera, and adding textures and lighting.

- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The tactics I used to approach designing software is by first taking a look at the goal and making a step-by-step list of small tasks to help me get there. This helps me keep track of everything that I need to do and keeps me organized.








2.) How do I approach developing programs?

- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Instead of writing all the code from scratch, I used libraries and formulas and incorporated those into my code.

- How did iteration factor into your development?

The iteration factor helped me gain a better understanding of compplicated concepts to visualize my project better. 

- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

My approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones as I took more time to understand what it was that was being asked of me and doing the best that I could.








3.) How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Within the scope of computational graphics and visualizations, I gained a better appreciation and understanding for the work done by engineers for graphics and game engines. However, I need to take the time to learn more and become proficient in this field.

- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

In working with existing libraries and code, I learned how to utilize computational graphics and visualizations. I also gained a better understanding of how color, space, and graphics work. Having this knowledge will help me reach new heights in my professional career.
